      DebateConference is a service that allows people to get matched into
      diverse physical groups to have conversations around their differences.
      Groups are matches based off a few simple questions by the moderator that

    Foundation for New Dialog is focused on ensuring everyone is able to come to
    the table to express their views, while also balancing the voices of the
    minority. We build social tools while trying to be mindful of echo chambers,
    the harm of toxic behavior, and unjust moderation or control. It's the
    conditions to solve these problems are:


    * Have people that see the problem from multiple perspectives,

    * Bring them together in which they have relationships of accountability to
    each other,

    * Within a zone in which they can talk privately,

    * They are reinforced with a reward for reaching a solution
